Resources to prepare for Quant Trader interviews.

This contains everything I found useful to prepare for my upcoming Optiver Quant Trader Intern interview.

# Links
[Alcumus: Practice tool for math competitions](https://figgie.com/). Honestly the #1 way to improve at probability. Set difficulty to "Insanely Hard", enable "Advance Only on Mastery", and grind "Counting & Probability" until all topics are at least blue, then grind your weaknesses even further (for me, Constructive Counting, Counting with Symmetry, Advanced Probability with Combinations)

[Brainstellar: Contains 100? common puzzles](https://brainstellar.com/puzzles). Helpful for technical interviews. You should memorize most of these

[Zetamac: Mental arithmetic game with customizable settings](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/). Helpful for OAs and mental speed

[OpenQuant: Quant math games (arithmetic, sequences, 80-in-8)](https://openquant.co/math-game). Helpful for OAs and mental speed

[Figgie: A card game by Jane Street](https://figgie.com/). Fun trading related game. Play with bots
